# Xena: Warrior Princess port knowledge report

## Identity and lane

- Supported revision: USA `SLUS-00977`
- Architecture: PSXRecomp static recompilation with interpreter fallback
- License boundary: project files use `GPL-3.0-only`; framework and game data
  keep separate rights and licenses
- Source provenance gap: the legacy Wave 1 package has no
  `project-manifest.toml` or `docs/FEASIBILITY.md`

## Current result

This work prepares a RetComM setup-host candidate. It does not establish a
portfolio quality state. Operator-visible gameplay, input, audio, saves, and
package-install checks remain open until their evidence exists.

## Corpus consulted

The run checked the required portfolio and release corpus before candidate
action. The owned USA CUE has one complete data track. The dated Wave 1 overlap
scan found no competing Xena: Warrior Princess recompilation.

## Publication update — 2026-09-03

The next standalone package candidate is `v0.1.1` for Windows x64, Linux
x64, macOS ARM64, and macOS x64. It uses package-only framework child
`e081d29da2fa9862204f63e6b2004d76f1d0cb2d`. Build-only CI and native package gates remain open. This
does not change the title's quality claim.
